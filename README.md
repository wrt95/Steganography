# Steganography

This is the 1st Coursework for F28HS Hardware-Software Interface, 2nd year of Bsc Computer Science.

This is a program that would be used for encoding a message into an image in .ppm format using a secret key, and retrieve it using the same secret key. This is my version of it.

The source code for this program has been encrypted in Steganography.zip due to the coursework being still used. 

If you want to have a look at the code, password can be requested from wrt_95@hotmail.com.
